# 254 Site Sinema 
## Project Goal:
Build a local sinema review site where if users search for a specific movie, they'll get rich details on:
1.Genre of the movie - a quick and simple audience glance that indicates the atmosphere of the movie. eg horror, romance, comedy etc 
2.Simple lines of text that describe the cast and their roles.
3.A simple trailer of the movie with a button on the homepage that once clicked it automatically plays.
5.The viewer knows the dates and countdown of the release date to a movie, the show times or any given ticket sales websites provided.
6.Reviews available to the viewer and button that a viewer can add their reviews after watching the trailer.

To run this project locally:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Project Details

### HTML Structure (`index.html`)

The main structure of the HTML file includes headers, navigation, search form, movie categories, and movie details placeholders.

### JavaScript (`script.js`)

JavaScript handles dynamic fetching of movie data, populating categories, displaying movies based on user interactions (like category selection, search, top movies, and latest movies).

### JSON Data (`movies.json`)

The JSON file contains movie data categorized by genres, each with a list of movies including title, description, release date, cast, image, trailer URL, and rating.
